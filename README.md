# face_recognition
I learned face recongition which is used machine learning(or A.I) algorithme
so i searched and found that it can be only used opencv(library) without openFace(library).
this uses openFace's data (it's called "nn4.small2.v1.t7").


-The directory
face detecting : openCV DNN Face Detecting
face_emedding  : openCV Face Embedding value(128 values on a face) with openFace <-- This can be used for svm trainning data
